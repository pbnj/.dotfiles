## Overview

My minimalist configurations.

Much of the guiding principles behind my development workflow revolves around
the [Unix Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy),
minimalism, simplicity, and composability.

As such, the major themes underpinning my personal setup are as follow:

- My editor is [`vim`](https://github.com/pbnj/dotfiles/blob/main/vim/.vimrc)
- My IDE is the surrounding environment: the shell, the compilers/interpreters,
  the various command-line applications and programs, the custom shell
  scripts/functions/aliases, ...etc
